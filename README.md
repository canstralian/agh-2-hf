# GitHub Repo to Spaces

GitHub Repo to Spaces is a tool designed to simplify the process of deploying any GitHub repository as a Hugging Face Space. This project automates the cloning, configuration, and deployment stepsâ€”allowing developers to quickly and seamlessly get their projects running on Hugging Faceâ€™s hosting platform.

Features
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Automated Deployment: Clone and deploy your GitHub repository directly into a Hugging Face Space.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Seamless Integration: Configures your repository to work smoothly in the Spaces environment.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Customizable: Supports various project structures and dependency management setups.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â User-Friendly: Ideal for developers and non-developers who want a quick deployment solution.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â A GitHub repository that you want to deploy.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â A Hugging Face account with access to Spaces.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Basic knowledge of Git and Python (if deploying locally or modifying the deployment script).

Installation
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/github-repo-to-spaces.git
cd github-repo-to-spaces


	2.	Install Dependencies:
If the project requires specific Python packages, install them using:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Configure the Application:
Update the configuration file (e.g., config.yaml or .env) with your specific settings:
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â GitHub Repository URL: The URL of the GitHub repository you wish to deploy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Hugging Face API Key: (If required) for interacting with the Spaces API.
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Any other project-specific configurations.

Usage

Deploying Your GitHub Repository
	1.	Set Your Repository URL:
Edit the configuration file to include the URL of the GitHub repository you want to deploy.
	2.	Run the Deployment Script:
Execute the main script to begin the deployment process:

python deploy.py


	3.	Access Your Space:
After the script completes, your project will be live on Hugging Face Spaces. Visit your Space URL to see the deployed application.

Updating an Existing Deployment

To update your deployed Space with the latest changes from your GitHub repository, run:

python deploy.py --update

Additional Configuration Options

For advanced usage (e.g., custom deployment options, handling private repositories, or environment-specific configurations), please refer to the Wiki or the inline comments within the configuration files.

Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during deployment, consider the following steps:
